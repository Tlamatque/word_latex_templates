	abstract = "In the last decade, the concept of modularity has caught the attention of engineers, management researchers and corporate strategists in a number of industries. When a product or process is {\grqq}modularized,” the elements of its design are split up and assigned to modules according to a formal architecture or plan. From an engineering perspective, a modularization generally has three purposes: • To make complexity manageable; • To enable parallel work; and • To accommodate future uncertainty. Modularity accommodates uncertainty because the particular elements of a modular design may be changed after the fact and in unforeseen ways as long as the design rules are obeyed. Thus, within a modular architecture, new module designs may be substituted for older ones easily and at low cost. This paper will make three basic points. First, we will show that modularity is a financial force that can change the structure of an industry. Then, we will explore the value and costs that are associated with constructing and exploiting a modular design. Finally we will examine the ways in which modularity shapes organizations and the risks that it poses for particular firms.1",

Quillen gave two different space level models, one via the plus construction and the other via the Q-construction. The Q construction version allowed Quillen to prove a number of important formal properties of the K-theory construction, namely localization, devissage, reduction by resolution, and the homotopy property. It was quickly realized that although the theory initially revolved around a functor K from the category of rings (or schemes) to the category Top of topological spaces, K in fact took its values in the category of infinite loop spaces and infinite loop maps ([1]). In fact, K is best thought of as a functor not to topological spaces, but to the category of spectra ([2], [11]). Recall that a spectrum is a family of based topological spaces {Xi}i 0, together with bonding maps i : Xi ! Xi+1, which can be taken to be homeomorphisms.",

	abstract = "The importance of conducting efficient product development is growing steadily as traditional market boundaries diminish and are replaced by global market conditions. Digital product development builds on the foundation that digital mock-ups replace physical mock-ups, and this has the potential for strongly improving the efficiency of the product development process. This is a rather drastic change compared to the conventional way of conducting product development, and it cannot be implemented overnight. It requires that the extended enterprise gradually adapts its processes, methods and tools to a design environment where geometry-based product information is the basis for product representation. Business excellence is therefore partially synonymous with managing this information and making it available, and relevant, to different activities and geometry users throughout the business environment. This thesis deals with the establishment of two key expressions, Geometry Management Process and Geometry Based Product Information. The objective is to improve the utilisation of Geometry Based Product Information by supporting the business environment with adequate methods, tools and processes for managing this type of information. Such an objective contributes to reuse of already existing information and therefore leads to elimination of rework in many activities, for example the downstream activities of traditional design departments. There are numerous influencing factors and the research approach has been to collect these factors into four separate but correlating domains. The consistency of the approach stems from the fact that all research work is conducted with a geometrical perspective on all types of activity, requirement and process. The methodology is elaborated through participation and surveys of real cases in ongoing projects and activities when developing heavyduty trucks. The result is a comprehensive framework of geometry management that should contribute towards increased business efficiency by utilisation of geometrical configuration management.",

This paper details the second module, the visualized simulation module, which validates and optimizes the related assembly process. The scope of simulation covers three aspects, those are, the tool path simulation, NC code simulation and assembly environment simulation. The system is developed based on CATIA and DELMIA.

	abstract = "While aircraft environmental performance has been important since the beginnings of commercial aviation, continuously increasing passenger traffic and a rise in public awareness have made aircraft noise and emissions two of the most pressing issues hampering commercial aviation growth today. This research explores the feasibility of integrating noise and emissions as optimization objectives at the aircraft conceptual design stage, thereby allowing a quantitative analysis of the trade-offs between environmental performance and operating cost. Beyond meeting regulations and establishing environmental performance trades, the design tool allows the generation of extremely low-noise and low-emissions designs that could, in the future, dramatically decrease the environmental impact of commercial aviation, albeit at the expense of increased operating cost. To these ends, a preliminary design tool was developed that uses a multiobjective genetic algorithm to determine optimal aircraft configurations and to estimate the sensitivities between the conflicting objectives of low noise, low emissions, and operating costs. The design tool incorporates ANOPP, a detailed noise prediction code developed at NASA Langley, and NASA Glenn’s NEPP engine simulator, as well as aircraft design, analysis, and optimization modules developed at Stanford.",

	abstract = "The issue of environmental sustainability, which is unprecedented in both magnitude and complexity, presents one of the biggest challenges faced by modern society. Design engineers can make significant contributions by incorporating environmental awareness into product and process development. It is critical that engineers make a paradigm shift in product design from centering on cost and performance to balancing economic, environmental, and societal considerations. Although there have been quite a few designs for environment (or ecodesign) tools developed, so far, these tools have only achieved limited industrial penetration. The present-day methods are either too qualitative to offer concrete solutions and not effective for designers with limited experience or too quantitative, costly, and time consuming. Thus, current ecodesign tools cannot be implemented during the early design phases. This paper develops a novel, semiquantitative ecodesign methodology that is targeted specifically toward the early stages of the design process. The new methodology is a combination of environmental life cycle assessment and visual tools such as quality function deployment, functional-component matrix, and Pugh chart. Since the early design process is function-oriented, a new visual tool called the function impact matrix has been developed to correlate environmental impacts with product function. Redesign of office staplers for reduced carbon footprint has been selected as a case study to demonstrate the use of the proposed approach. Life cycle assessment results confirm that the new stapler design generated using this methodology promotes improved environmental performance. ",

Unlike the conventional approaches, this method decouples the overall decomposition process into two separate, autonomous function components: dependency analysis and matrix partitioning, which are algorithmically achieved by an extended Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) and a Partition Point Analysis (PPA), respectively. The extended HCA (Phase 1) is applied to convert the (input) incidence matrix, which is originally unorganized, into a banded diagonal matrix. The PPA (Phase 2) is applied to further transform this matrix into a block-angular matrix according to a given set of decomposition criteria. This method provides both flexibility in the choice of the different settings on the decomposition criteria, and diversity in the generation of the decomposition solutions, both taking place in Phase 2 without resort to Phase 1. These features essentially make this decomposition method effective, especially in its application to re-decomposition. A powertrain design example is employed for illustration and discussion. ",

We define a product family to be a set of such products, and refer to the set of common parts as the product platform. Product platforms enable rapid adjustment to changing market needs while keeping development costs and time-cycles low. In many cases, however, the individual product requirements are conflicting when designing a product family. The designer must balance the tradeoff between maximizing commonality and minimizing individual product performance deviations. The design challenge is to select the product platform that will generate family designs with minimum deviation from individual optima. We propose a methodology that combines two previous approaches developed for making commonality decisions. In the first approach optimal values and sensitivity information from the individually optimized variants are used to indicate components that are probable candidates for sharing. In the second approach a relaxed combinatorial problem is formulated to maximize sharing among variants subject to bounds on performance reduction for the individually optimized values. In the combined methodology the first approach is used to identify an initial set of shared components and define the candidate platform to be considered by the second approach. The computational load is reduced significantly and the platform-selection problem is solved in a more robust manner. The proposed methodology is demonstrated on the design of an automotive engine family."

In particular, a full scale of decomposability analysis and complexity analysis in the context of decomposition are presented along with approaches and algorithms. These new analyses not only address the viability and validity of decomposition, but also help achieve an optimal number of subproblems during decomposition, which is usually determined by trial and error or a priori.

This effort leads to an enhanced decomposition method able to find the most appropriate decomposition solution to a complex design problem. ",

We demonstrate that this principle does not enable one to make optimal decisions concerning how variety should proliferate in the assembly process. Therefore, we propose to complement this principle in that we additionally consider the variety induced complexity throughout the assembly process. The weighted Shannon entropy is proposed as a measure for the evaluation of this complexity. Our results show that the delayed product differentiation principle is reliable when the selection probabilities of module variants at each assembly stage are equal and the pace at which value is added in the whole assembly process is constant. Otherwise, the proposed measure provides different results. Furthermore, the entropy measure provides interesting clues concerning eventual reversals of assembly sequences and supports decisions regarding what modules in an assembly stage could be substituted by a common module.",

After separate functional modeling of each product variant, the individual functional models are merged into a single, coherent, and unified family functional model to determine all the shared and individual behavioral modules. The modularity in the family functional model is further explicitly identified using a behavioral modularity matrix of product variants versus behavior. The proposed approach provides a fast method for generating new concept variants during the conceptual design of a family of products. The rationale of managing modularity in product family design with functional modeling is manifested using a modular design example of a family of automatic assembly devices.",

It is well documented that a manufacturing company competes with others in its industry on five dimensions: Price, quality, flexibility, delivery, and service. According to the existing literature, mass customization provides significant strategic advantage in two of these dimensions—price and customization. We, however, argue that when properly implemented, the cellular manufacturing structure associated with the appropriate implementation of mass customization strategy, provides additional competitive value in quality and delivery. Furthermore by virtue of the customer co-design as an integral aspect of mass customization, customer satisfaction also improves under this strategy. Mass customization strategy, therefore, provides competitive advantage in all five competitive dimensions simultaneously—a truly unique strategic accomplishment. We also propose, in this paper, new metrics for mass customization strategy that measure the mass as well as the customization aspects of this strategy. Finally, we describe in the clearest terms the modus operandi of modularity in product design and the role it plays in bringing about high levels of customization on one hand and economies of scale at component level, on the other. We conclude with remarks that underscore the need for conducting research in the areas at the interface of mass customization and supply chain management.",

	abstract = "The idea of modularity has gained acceptance because of so-called mass customisation and the need for shorter development time in manufacturing. Modularity is a general concept, and many engineering problems can be generalised under the umbrella of modularity. Numerous studies have been carried out on modularity-relevant issues; however, systematic classification has not been discussed for modularity in terms of its applications and methodologies for developing modularity in systems. This paper presents a taxonomy on modularity applications, research issues, and design methodologies. It provides a general framework for further systematic development of modularity in systems. General solutions to identified problems which should be studied in future are also discussed. ",

	abstract = {Developing a robust, product platform architecture brings an important competitive advantage to a company. The major benefits are reduced design effort and time-to-market for future generations of the product. This paper describes a step-by-step method that aids companies in developing such product platform architectures. Using the concept of specification "flows" within a product development project, the design for variety (DFV) method develops two indices to measure a product's architecture. The first index is the generational variety index (GVI), a measure for the amount of redesign effort required for future designs of the product. The second index is the coupling index (CI), a measure of the coupling among the product components. The design team uses these two indices to develop a decoupled architecture that requires less design effort for follow-on products. This paper describes the DFV method and uses a water cooler example to illustrate the method.},
